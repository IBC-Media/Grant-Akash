                  >Unlike centralized systems where a single authority holds significant power, decentralized blockchains leverage a consensus mechanism, typically through methods like Proof of Work or Proof of Stake, to validate and agree upon the state of the ledger. This distributed approach enhances security by reducing vulnerabilities to single points of failure</span

                  A decentralized ledger is a revolutionary concept in the realm of distributed technologies, with blockchain standing out as a prominent example. Unlike traditional centralized ledgers maintained by a single authority, a decentralized ledger operates on a network of interconnected nodes, each holding a copy of the ledger.</span

In the context of various technologies, including computer systems, networks, and distributed systems, failure resilience is a critical characteristic that ensures the continued functionality and availability of services even in the face of unexpected issues.</span
